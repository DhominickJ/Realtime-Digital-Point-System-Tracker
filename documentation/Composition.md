### Routing:

### Framework:
 The framework uses PHP as the main backend solution while ensuring that the database and the system works alongside the Vite as the main packaging platform. It uses bramusrouter to route the pages as the pages are compiled for production with: 
 > bun run vite-build

 As the database gets updated, it ensures that the pages are loaded with realtime interference from the subsequent pages. While PHP normally doesn't do this, this allows for a more efficient way to produce the needed route and pages.
